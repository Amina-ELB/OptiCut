In order to achieve this a number of improvements have been made to the elliptic reinitialisation method including; reformulation of the underlying minimisation problem driving the solution; adoption of a Lagrange multiplier approach for enforcing a Dirichlet boundary condition on the implicit level set interface; and adoption of a narrow band approach. Numerical examples confirm the high-order accuracy of the resultant method by demonstrating experimental orders of convergence congruent with optimal convergence rates for the SIPG method, that is hp+1 and hp in the L2 and DG norms respectively. Furthermore, the degree to which the level set function satisfies the Eikonal equation improves proportionally to hp, and the often ignored homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on the interface is shown to be satisfied accurately with a rate of convergence of at least h2 for all polynomial orders.}

The resulting algorithm is fast since it does not require a sorting strategy as found, e.g., in the fast marching method. In addition, it providesa way to compute solutions to a class of HJ equations for which the conventional fast marching method is not applicable.

	abstract = {Fictitious-domain methods are attractive for shape optimization applications, since they do not require deformed or re-generated meshes. A recently developed such method is the {CutFEM} approach, which allows crisp boundary representations and for which uniformly well-conditioned system matrices can be guaranteed. Here we investigate the use of the {CutFEM} approach for acoustic shape optimization, using as test problem the design of an acoustic horn for favorable impedance-matching properties. The {CutFEM} approach is used to solve the Helmholtz equation, and the geometry of the horn is implicitly described by a level-set function. To promote smooth algorithmic updates of the geometry, we propose to use the nodal values of the Laplacian of the level-set function as design variables. This strategy also improves the algorithm’s convergence rate, counteracts mesh dependence, and, in combination with Tikhonov regularization, controls small details in the optimized designs. An advantage with the proposed method is that the exact derivatives of the discrete objective function can be expressed as boundary integrals, as opposed to when using a traditional method that employs mesh deformations. The resulting horns possess excellent impedance-matching properties and exhibit surprising sub-wavelength structures, not previously seen, which are possible to capture due to the ﬁxed-mesh approach.

(2014) as the core of a robust topology optimization framework for 3D laminar incompressible flow and species transport problems at low Reynolds numbers (Re{\textless}200). {CutFEM} is a methodology for discretizing partial differential equations on complex geometries by immersed boundary techniques. In this study, the geometry of the fluid domain is described by an explicit level set method, where the parameters of a discretized level set function are defined as functions of the optimization variables. The fluid behavior is modeled by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Species transport is modeled by an advection–diffusion equation. The governing equations are discretized in space by a generalized extended finite element method. Face-oriented ghost-penalty terms are added for stability reasons and to improve the conditioning of the system. The boundary conditions are enforced weakly via Nitsche’s method. The emergence of isolated volumes of fluid surrounded by solid during the optimization process leads to a singular analysis problem. An auxiliary indicator field is modeled to identify these volumes and to impose a constraint on the average pressure. Numerical results for 3D, steady-state and transient problems demonstrate that the {CutFEM} analyses are sufficiently accurate, and the optimized designs agree well with results from prior studies solved in 2D or by density approaches.},

The free boundary, represented by an approximate signed distance function on a fixed background mesh, is allowed to intersect elements in an arbitrary fashion. This leads to so called cut elements in the vicinity of the boundary. To obtain a stable method, stabilization terms is added in the vicinity of the cut elements penalizing the gradient jumps across element sides. The stabilization also ensures good conditioning of the resulting discrete system. We develop a method for shape optimization based on moving the distance function along a velocity field which is computed as the \$H{\textasciicircum}1\$ Riesz representation of the shape derivative. We show that the velocity field is the solution to an interface problem and we prove an a priori error estimate of optimal order, given the limited regularity of the velocity field across the interface, for the the velocity field in the \$H{\textasciicircum}1\$ norm. Finally, we present illustrating numerical results.},

abstract = {We present a cut finite element method for shape optimization in the case of linear elasticity. The elastic domain is defined by a level-set function, and the evolution of the domain is obtained by moving the level-set along a velocity field using a transport equation. The velocity field is the largest decreasing direction of the shape derivative that satisfies a certain regularity requirement and the computation of the shape derivative is based on a volume formulation. Using the cut finite element method no re-meshing is required when updating the domain and we may also use higher order finite element approximations. To obtain a stable method, stabilization terms are added in the vicinity of the cut elements at the boundary, which provides control of the variation of the solution in the vicinity of the boundary. We implement and illustrate the performance of the method in the two-dimensional case, considering both triangular and quadrilateral meshes as well as finite element spaces of different order.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a level set method to solve minimum stress and stress-constrained shape and topology optimization problems. The method solves a sub-optimization problem every iteration to obtain optimal boundary velocities. A p-norm stress functional is used to aggregate stresses in a single constraint. The shape sensitivity function is derived and a computational procedure based on a least squares interpolation approach is devised in order to compute sensitivities at the boundaries. Adaptive constraint scaling is used to enforce exact control of stress limits. Numerical results show that the method is able to solve the problem efficiently for single and multiple load cases obtaining solutions with smooth boundaries.}

The original zero level set interface is preserved by means of applying modified boundary conditions to a surrogate/approximate interface weakly with a penalty method. Narrow band technique is adopted to reinforce the robustness of the proposed method where a smooth initial guess for the nonlinear equation is given by solving a Laplace's equation. Numerical benchmarks in both two dimensions and three dimensions confirm the optimal convergence rates under several different error measures including an interface error measure, showing that our method is accurate and robust. A three-dimensional genus 2 surface is adopted to demonstrate the capability of the method for the reinitialization of complicated geometries.},
