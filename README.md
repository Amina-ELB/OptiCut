OptiCut is a shape optimization framework that combines the **level set** method with the **Cut Finite Element Method** and the **Ersatz material** approach. 
The version is implemented with [CutFEMx](https://github.com/sclaus2/CutFEMx).

Documentation is provided in this link [OptiCut](https://amina-elb.github.io/OptiCut/). Two demonstrations of the proposed framework are presented. The first involves the minimization of structural compliance using both the Ersatz method and the CutFEMx method. The second focuses on the minimization of the Láµ– norm of the von Mises stress, employing the CutFEMx method.
